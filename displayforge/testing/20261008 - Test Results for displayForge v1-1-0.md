# Test Results — displayForge v1.1.0

*2026-10-08 · the KognogOS test desktop (Sway, three screens). Matrix: [20261008 - Test Matrix for displayForge v1-1-0](20261008%20-%20Test%20Matrix%20for%20displayForge%20v1-1-0.md). Issues: F-4 #50 · F-5 #51.*

## 1 · Automated (Claude)

- `python -W always -m unittest discover -s tests` on forgekit 0.10.0: **63 tests pass**, warnings as in the changelog. ✅
- Every fix in this version was also checked the other way: taken out once, its test seen failing, put back. ✅

## 2 · Javier's runs, inside hypeForge Settings (Screens page), from the source folders (`scripts/try-unreleased.sh`)

Three runs on 2026-10-08, free-form rather than row by row:

1. **Afternoon, the first look:** the underlined letters weren't all shortcuts, Help had no number, "1-N screens" was confusing, Q still quit inside Settings, Try/Save showed everywhere (displayForge), History's numbers jumped into its sub-pages (nogForge), "Boot menu" should be "Boot Menu". → all fixed in this version.
2. **Evening, the second look:** "bottom bar, awesome!". A menu opened by its number didn't close on the second press; the open menu wasn't lit; letters should follow one rule (the first letter, else the next free one); About and License (then Keys and the Manual too) belonged in the work area, not windows. → fixed in forgekit 0.10.0, picked up here.
3. **Evening, the third look:** the page's own highlight stayed lit while Help or History was open. → fixed; Javier: **"perfect!"**

## 3 · Still to run — on the installed package

The matrix rows are run once more by Javier on the **locally built package**, installed through nog, before anything goes to the AUR (the release rule). Results go here.
